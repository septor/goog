# GOOG - Google [object] Plugin!

Do you use a service from Google? Does it have a supported API (Calendar, Maps, etc)? Would you like to utilize those features on your e107 install?

Hopefully this plugin will allow for that. First up is Calendar. Then I have no idea. (In reality you know as well as I do that I'll probably only make it to the Calendar bit before I move on to something else).

I'll update this when I have more information!
